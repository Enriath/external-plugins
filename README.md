# Contextual Cursor
Remember how RSHD had a custom mouse cursor when you hovered over stuff? Well it's (mostly) back!

### Missing Features vs RSHD (and other known issues):
* The cursor will not display when hovering over minimenu options.
* RL tooltips are partially underneath the cursor when they're displayed below the cursor
* Many things that should have contextual cursors don't. Feel free to make an issue suggesting them!
* The plugin conflicts with the core `Custom Cursor` plugin, due to both affecting the cursor. If you manage to have 
both on at the same time, the `Contextual Cursor` will override it, but there's a warning to try and stop that.
