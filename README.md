# Coffin Counter
*Track what remains your coffin contains.*

This was made nice and easy by Jagex for three main reasons:
1. You can only ever own one coffin at a time, with no possibility of overlap or confusion if ever swapping.
2. There is a message whenever remains are put into the open coffin.
3. Removing any items from the coffin puts the entire contents of the coffin into chat.

So thanks Jagex, you made this possible <3

The overlay only shows you the colours for the remains it contains. Here's what it looks like with all 6:
