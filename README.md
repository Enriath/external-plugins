# Contextual Cursor
Remember how RSHD had a custom mouse cursor when you hovered over stuff? Well it's (mostly) back!

### Missing Features vs RSHD (and other known issues):
* RL tooltips are partially underneath the cursor when they're displayed below the cursor
* Many things that should have contextual cursors don't. Feel free to make an issue suggesting them!
