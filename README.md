# Transmogrification
*Wear the armour you want, no matter what you're doing.*

It's time to fight back against Graceful-scape. With this plugin, you can change your armour to whatever you want.
Only you can see it, but it will make activities centred around running (so most skilling) much nicer to look at.

Notably, this plugin only changes armour. No weapons, shields, or followers; Weapons and Shields because of animations,
and followers because they're a magnitude harder, and c'mon, earn your own pet trophies.


## How to use:
Enabling the plugin will add two buttons to your Equipment tab. The mask can quickly toggle your Transmog once set up,
and the spanner is where all the configuration magic happens.

In there, set your default state by following the instructions, then start playing around with it! Click the `?` button
for some more help.

Do note: Hair, Jaws, and Sleeves are pretty buggy. You may need to toggle transmog after removing/readding them. If
they're clipping into your outfit, try setting them to "Follow Armour".
