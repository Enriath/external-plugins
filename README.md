# Crate Limiter
*Woah there, do you know how fast you were opening those crates?*

Have you ever been opening Eclectic Impling Jars for medium clues and thought "Wow, this is just too fast! What if I get
a medium clue!". Or do you just want to keep a specific tempo while smashing left mouse as fast as humanly possible?

Either way, this plugin limits you to open openables at a constant rate, such as 1 per tick, 1 every 2 ticks, etc.
The speed limit is 1 per tick, don't want to run over any innocent loot entries do you?

What it works on:
* Impling Jars
* Seed packs
* Crates of many varieties (Todt, Construction, LMS)
